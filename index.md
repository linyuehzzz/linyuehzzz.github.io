      I am an Assistant Professor in the 
      <a href="https://ggis.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">
        Department of Geography & Geographic Information Science
      </a> 
      at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research lies at the intersection of <strong>data</strong>, <strong>computation</strong>, and <strong>human values</strong>. 
      I critically engage with geospatial computing and artificial intelligence—both in practice and theory—to explore how emerging technologies can be designed and deployed in ethical, socially responsible ways.

### Research Interests

My current work focuses on:

- **GeoAI and Society**  
  Examining how artificial intelligence shapes, and is shaped by, geographic knowledge and spatial technologies.

- **Geospatial computing for equity**  
  Investigating how new computational methods can help uncover and reduce social and spatial inequalities.

- **Privacy-preserving spatial analysis**  
  Designing techniques that protect individual privacy while enabling the use of geospatial data for research and policy.

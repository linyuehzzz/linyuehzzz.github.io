I am Assistant Instructional Professor of GIScience at the [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/), [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). My research is situated at the intersection of **data**, **computation**, and **human values**. My research aims to answer the question: How can we develop computational methods, which are increasingly complex, to embody social responsibility, preserve privacy, and be used to understand and mitigate inequalities and injustices? To achieve this, (1) I explore integrating social justice principles into geospatial methods to address the needs of individuals and communities with varying levels of vulnerability. (2) I work on developing methods to protect individual privacy while maintaining the utility of geospatial data. (3) In addition, I am intersted in how new geospatial computing methods can be used to help understand and reduce inqeualities and improve quality of life.

I am Assistant Professor at the [Department of Geography & Geographic Information Science](https://ggis.illinois.edu/), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research is situated at the intersection of **data**, **computation**, and **human values**, from which I aim to critically engage with geospatial computing and artificial intelligence, both practically and theoretically, to explore how new technologies can be developed and used along ethical and socially responsible lines. My work has been focused on issues such as:

-Explore societal influences of GeoAI and AI for geospatial applications.
-Exploring how new geospatial computing methods can help understand and reduce inequalities and improve quality of life.
-Developing methods to protect individual privacy while providing useful geospatial data.


**Education**
- Ph.D. in Geography, The Ohio State University, 2023
- M.A. in Geography, The Ohio State University, 2022
- B.S. in Geographic Information Science, Wuhan University, 2019

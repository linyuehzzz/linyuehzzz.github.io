I am an (incoming) Assistant Instructional Professor of GIScience in the Division of the Social Sciences and the College at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). My research is situated at the intersection of geospatial data, computation, and human values, and I am passionate about developing innovative computational and statistical methodologies that leverage the power of geospatial data to solve practical social problems while prioritizing human interests and values. My current work focuses on the development of computational methods to ensure privacy, fidelity, and equity in the dissemination and mining of geospatial data.

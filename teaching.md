Below are my current offerings at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign:

**GGIS 403: Geographic Information Science and Systems** (Spring 2026)
The course introduces the conceptual and technical foundations of geographic information science (GIScience) through Python programming. Students will learn about the unique characteristics of geospatial vector and raster data, including their capture, processing, storage, analysis, communication, and interpretation, and develop the ability to apply information science techniques and critical spatial-thinking skills to address geospatial challenges. This course is intended for those students interested in geospatial data science in Python. It does not include instruction in GIS software.

**GGIS 527: Geospatial Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** (Fall 2025)
In this course, students will learn a variety of Geospatial AI and Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks) and their applications in geography and related areas. Students will gain hands-on experience with geospatial data and tools to detect patterns, clusters, and classes, as well as perform geotext mining and image processing using cutting-edge AI/ML methods.

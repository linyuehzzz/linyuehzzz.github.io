Below are my current offerings at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign:

**GGIS 527: Geospatial Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** (Fall 2025)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant progress in recent years, and several AI algorithms have even surpassed human ability at tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine translation. The intersection of AI and geospatial analysis creates massive and unprecedented opportunities for knowledge discovery and innovative applications. Many Geospatial AI and Machine Learning applications have emerged in diverse disciplines, such as geography and geographic information science, agriculture, business, economics, sustainable development, and urban planning. In this course, students will learn a variety of Geospatial AI and Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks) and their applications in geography and related areas. Students will gain hands-on experience with geospatial data and tools to detect patterns, clusters, and classes, as well as perform geotext mining and image processing using cutting-edge AI/ML methods.

**GGIS 527: Geographic Information Science and Systems** (Spring 2026)
This course will introduce the conceptual and technical fundamentals of geographic information science as a gateway to advanced study, and cover geographic information science as an interdisciplinary scientific field and geographic information systems as a tool in many application domains. Students will learn the unique characteristics of geospatial data and its capture, processing, storage, analysis, communication, and interpretation. In addition, they will use Python to implement information science techniques and apply critical spatial-thinking skills to address geospatial challenges.
